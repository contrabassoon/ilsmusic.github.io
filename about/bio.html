    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Ishaan Subramanian is a multi-instrumentalist with a passion for education. His first instrument after the recorder in elementary general music was the cello, in fourth grade. In fifth grade, he started playing saxophone as well, but in seventh grade, his band director asked him to play bassoon instead, and he agreed. In his junior year of high school, he joined New Jersey Youth Symphony's Youth Symphony and Youth Orchestra on bassoon and cello respectively, which sparked his passion for music and music education.</p>

      <p>Ishaan currently studies Music Education and Computer Science at the University of Miami, and his principal instrument is bassoon. He is a member of the Frost Band of the Hour, where he plays trumpet, and the pep band, where he plays piccolo, saxophone, trumpet, and trombone. He also plays bassoon and oboe in Frost Symphonic Winds. At the University of Miami, he makes a point of trying new instruments as much as possible.</p>
      
      <p>As an educator, he teaches cello and bassoon at New Jersey Youth Symphony's Summer Winds camp. He is an advocate of becoming well versed in any music, not just the music that is common on ones primary instrument. He derives his passion for teaching from the belief that music has the potential to be a powerful and positive force in the lives of students.â€‹</p>
      
      <p>Ishaan enjoys arranging, and several of his arrangements have been performed. Some of his most notable arrangements are Gounod's Funeral March of a Marionette for bassoon quartet, Excerpts from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker for reed quintet, and Dvorak's Symphony no. 8 for double reed octet.
